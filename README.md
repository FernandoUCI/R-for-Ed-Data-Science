# Intro to R for Education Data Science - Winter 2019
Instructors: 
Fernando Rodriguez (main instructor)<br>
Christian Fischer<br>
Ha Nguyen<br>
Renzhe Yu<br>
Ying Xu<br>

Thursdays, 11am-12pm


This workshop will teach you how to use R to wrangle, analyze, and visualize education data. We will specifically focus on understanding how to 
explore clickstream data, which are timestamped events of students' clicks events within a Learning Management System (LMS), in order to gain insights into students'
learning behaviors in an online Physics course. 

Our hope is that this workshop gets you excited about using R and the concepts you learn can be easily transferable to your own research projects.

To access the workshop lessons, open the R-Markdown files (e.g., Lesson_1.md) within this repository. I will upload the notebooks after the end of each session.
